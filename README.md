# Project 2: Holiday Planner

## Developers

By: Jabriel Kane Cabaluna, Joanna Collette, and Stevie Helber

## Description

This project we were tasked with finding out what we wanted to do with our project by creating a front-end and back-end server that would use certain things that our class has learned within the past few weeks. Our group decided to do a weekly planner that would allow users to log in and register their credentails and to come back and look back at what they put down for them to do. Our group had other ideas for this planner to make it more useful and exciting by adding a Christmas theme to the planner and other festive things.
